My automation framework is built on Playwright, organized into three main folders:
tests for test cases, pages for page objects, and util for utility functions. 
It utilizes an .env file to securely store configuration details like the URL, email, and password. After test execution, an HTML report is generated I have attached the screenshot of report in the document
